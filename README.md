# Hash-Map-Example
This is code that I wrote to show how python hash maps work under the hood using a combination of an array with linked lists.
<br>
The array.py file imports linked lists from the testlinked.py file and adds them as elements of the base array.

There's an image to show my graphical representation of what the code does under the hood.
